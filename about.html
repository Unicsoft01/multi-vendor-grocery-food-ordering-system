proposed system, "AreaFood," presents a significant improvement over
the existing manual system of food ordering by introducing a digital platform
that streamlines the ordering process, enhances convenience for customers, and
improves operational efficiency for restaurants. By leveraging mobile
technology and location-based services, the "AreaFood" application
offers users in Anyigba a user-friendly interface for browsing menus, placing
orders, and tracking deliveries directly from their smartphones. This digital
solution eliminates the need for manual order taking and processing, reducing
errors, and delays while providing real-time information about menu
availability, pricing, and order status.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: " open="" sans",="" arial,="" sans-serif;="" font-size:="" 14px;"="">

the progress of their orders in real-time, receive notifications about order
status updates, and make secure payments electronically, eliminating the need
for cash transactions and improving transaction security. Additionally, the
system's integration with Google Maps and Google Location API enables users to
discover nearby restaurants based on their current location, expanding their
choice and accessibility of food options in Anyigba.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
